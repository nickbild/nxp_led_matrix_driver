# NXP i.MX RT1010 EVK RGB LED Matrix Driver

Drive a 32x32 RGB LED matrix with the NXP [i.MX RT1010 EVK](http://nxp.com/imxrt1010evk).  Any matrix that is drop-in compatible with the [Adafruit 1484](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1484) will work.

Top view of the EVK.  The strange looking wires are standard 22AWG copper wires wrapped in aluminum foil.  The i.MX RT1010 EVK GPIOs switch *very* fast, so EMI shielding was a must to prevent spurious signals from producing unwanted visual artifacts on the matrix.

Some sample images.  Taking images of an illuminated LED matrix is very difficult.  It definitely looks better in person.
